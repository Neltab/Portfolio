# My personnal website

## Introduction

Not so long ago, a new JS runtime was published : [Bun](https://bun.sh/). With my website getting old, not in age but in the way it was built as I was still a student. So I decided to make a new one using this new, fast and most importantly all-in-one JavaScript runtime. The idea is more to showcase my journey discovering a new environment than just building a new website. 

## The Unexpected Journey
As I said, Bun is quite new as I am writing this down. And with its publishing, the flame of motivation I was lacking burst out of nowhere. So after a week of tinkering with it, I decided that it was finaly the time to make a great project. The goal of this journey is to prepare the place for a sandbox where I can easily dive into many other smaller projects.

## What will come next
First, I have to bring back the old website. It contained all my projects as well as my resume and I still need to showcase them.
Right after, a blog will come. The reason of the failure of many projects was the lack of motivation. I figured out that if I have a way to interest people with my projects, I may have a chance to finish them.
Finaly, once that the foundations are in place, my first goal will be to play around with some shaders and GPU stuff.
